# This specific template is located at:

# Build a Docker image with CI/CD and push to the GitLab registry.
# Docker-in-Docker documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html

# This template uses one generic job with conditional builds
# for the default branch and all other (MR) branches.

docker-build:
  # Use the official docker image.
  image: docker:compose
  stage: build
  services:
    - docker:dind
  # All other branches are tagged with the escaped branch name (commit ref slug)
  script:
    - docker build --pull -t "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE${tag}" .
    - docker push "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE${tag}"
    - docker compose up
  # Run this job in a branch where a Dockerfile exists
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH
      exists: 
        - Dockerfile
